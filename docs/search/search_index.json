Overview \u00b6 Detecting changes in surface conditions requires establishing reference or \"baseline\" conditions to be used for comparison. Our approach uses time series of Landsat observations to estimate a series of harmonic baseline models that account for seasonal variability in vegetation conditions and builds on previously published methods . An ensemble of the n preceding harmonic models is used to estimate the average anomaly in Greenness for a given acquisition date. By then aggregating average anomalies over a specified monitoring period (i.e. summer growing season), a relatively stable and robust annual estimate of change in Greenness can be produced. Spatial smoothing and thresholding by anomaly magnitude improves visualization of disturbance patches, and the resulting map products can be used to compare disturbances across years. Workflow \u00b6 Our workflow is designed to generate estimates of mean annual Tasseled Cap Greenness anomalies over large spatial extents using Google Earth Engine . The original workflow was based on Landsat Collection 1 (C1) but has recently been updated for use with Collection 2 (C2) Surface Reflectance products available in Earth Engine .

Previous releases of this app displayed results based on Landsat Collection 1 inputs. All analysis has been re-run using the Landsat Collection 2 workflow and results have been updated (2021-12-05). To view these preliminary results, visit our Condition Monitoring Explorer App . This app can be used to view detected changes in vegetation condition by year. You can use the slider widgets to select the map year and update change detection threshold. Mean scores greater than or less than specified threshold are displayed, with positive changes (increased Greenness) in blue tones and negative changes (decreased Greenness) in red tones. Map transparency is scaled to uncertainty in score estimates such that areas with greater variability in scores across dates/models are more transparent. Click the map to view a time series of annual condition score estimates for the clicked point. Use the TCG button to switch to a chart of the Greeness time series. Time series plots include the mean score for each year as well as lines representing the mean plus and minus one standard deviation for a clicked point. Additional chart options allow you to view the number of observations used for monitoring, and clear the chart panel from the screen.

This approach is particularly suited for monitoring using vegetation indices in regions/ecosystems with strong phenological signals. We use the following model form: where y is the predicted vegetation index (e.g. Tasseled Cap Greenness), x is the ordinal date of each observation; a 0 is the modeled intercept; b 0 is the modeled slope; N is a set of integers specifying the frequency, j , of the Fourier series harmonics (e.g. N = {1, 3}, corresponding to 12-month and 4-month harmonics); a j are the sine coefficients and b j are the cosine coefficients estimated at each frequency; T is the number of days in a year ( T = 365.25); and \u03b5 t is the residual error term for each observation. Condition Scores \u00b6 Condition scores are calculated as the difference between the observed and predicted reflectance values for a given acquisition date, and are normalized by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the baseline model used to generate the predicted value: Thus, scores represent the magnitude of change in reflectance relative to the uncertainty in baseline model fit. Ensemble Approach \u00b6 Previous implementations of this workflow have relied on a single baseline model for prediction and monitoring such that a single condition score is generated for each acquisition date. However, selection of a suitable baseline period may be challenging in frequently disturbed landscapes and noise in reflectance observations may impact the quality of models fit to different time periods. Therefore, the latest version of our workflow utilizes an ensemble approach that combines condition scores estimates from multiple baselines. Baseline models are fit using a moving window and the n models preceding the specified monitoring period are used to generate a set of n condition score estimates for each acquired image during the specified monitoring period. These scores can then be averaged across all dates within the monitoring period to produce a more robust estimate of potential condition change. Our final assessment products combine results across Landsat Paths and include per-pixel mean and standard deviation of scores as well as number of observations used for monitoring.","title":"Harmonic modeling"},{"location":"harmonics/#condition-scores","text":"Condition scores are calculated as the difference between the observed and predicted reflectance values for a given acquisition date, and are normalized by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the baseline model used to generate the predicted value: Thus, scores represent the magnitude of change in reflectance relative to the uncertainty in baseline model fit.","title":"Condition Scores"},{"location":"harmonics/#ensemble-approach","text":"Previous implementations of this workflow have relied on a single baseline model for prediction and monitoring such that a single condition score is generated for each acquisition date.
