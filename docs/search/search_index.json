Overview \u00b6 Detecting changes in surface conditions requires establishing reference or \"baseline\" conditions to be used for comparison. Our approach uses time series of Landsat observations to estimate a series of harmonic baseline models that account for seasonal variability in vegetation conditions and builds on previously published methods . This ensemble of harmonic models is used to estimate the average anomaly in Greenness for a given acquisition date. By then aggregating these average anomalies over a specified monitoring period (i.e. summer growing season), a relatively stable and robust annual estimate of change in Greenness can be produced. Spatial smoothing and thresholding by anomaly magnitude improves visualization of disturbance patches, and the resulting map products can be used to compare disturbances across years. Workflow \u00b6 Our workflow can be used to process Landsat time series and generate mean annual Tasseled Cap Greenness anomalies over large spatial extents using Google Earth Engine . Earth Engine users can add this repository with Reader access here . The scripts in this repository include: workflow_by_state/ 1S_v7_baseline_generator - Generate harmonic baseline models using fixed-length moving window (default: 5-year models) 2S_v7_predict_monitor - Estimate average Greenness anomalies for dates within monitoring period (default: May-September) 3S_v7_assessments_combine - Combine results across orbital Paths 4S_v7_visualization - Spatially smooth and threshold for visualization app/ APP_v7_disturbance_atlas - Interactive mapping App with select by year utils.js - Utility functions shared across scripts While these scripts are expected to provide a useful starting point for those seeking to replicate or build on our methods, users should carefully review all paths, inputs, and other parameter specifications in order to tune to their own study areas. Note: Current scripts have been developed and tested for US State geographies, and example products are available for a selection of Northeastern states within USFS Region 9.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#harmonic-condition-monitoring","text":"The tools and workflow described in these docs and hosted in the associated repositories on GitHub and Earth Engine are designed to support spatially and temporally consistent Landsat-based condition change monitoring for retrospective disturbance assessment at regional to national scales.","title":"Harmonic condition monitoring"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Detecting changes in surface conditions requires establishing reference or \"baseline\" conditions to be used for comparison.
