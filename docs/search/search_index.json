Overview \u00b6 Detecting changes in surface conditions requires establishing reference or \"baseline\" conditions to be used for comparison. Our approach uses time series of Landsat observations to estimate a series of harmonic baseline models that account for seasonal variability in vegetation conditions and builds on previously published methods . An ensemble of the n preceding harmonic models is used to estimate the average anomaly in Greenness for a given acquisition date. By then aggregating average anomalies over a specified monitoring period (i.e. summer growing season), a relatively stable and robust annual estimate of change in Greenness can be produced. Spatial smoothing and thresholding by anomaly magnitude improves visualization of disturbance patches, and the resulting map products can be used to compare disturbances across years. Workflow \u00b6 Our workflow is designed to generate estimates of mean annual Tasseled Cap Greenness anomalies over large spatial extents using Google Earth Engine . Earth Engine users can add this repository with Reader access here . The scripts in this repository include: app/ APP_disturbance_atlas - Interactive mapping app with select by year workflow_by_state/ 1_baseline_generator - Generate harmonic baseline models using fixed-length moving window (default: 5-year models) 2_monitor_assess - Estimate average Greenness anomalies for dates within monitoring period (default: May 1 - September 30) and combine results across orbital Paths 3_visualization - Spatially smooth and threshold for visualization utils.js - Utility functions shared across scripts While these scripts are expected to provide a useful starting point for those seeking to replicate or build on our methods, users should carefully review all paths, inputs, and other parameter specifications in order to tune to their own study areas. Note: Current scripts have been developed and tested for US State geographies, and example products are available for select Northeastern states within USFS Region 9.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#harmonic-condition-monitoring","text":"The tools and workflow described in these docs and hosted in the associated repositories on GitHub and Earth Engine are designed to support spatially and temporally consistent Landsat-based condition change monitoring for retrospective disturbance assessment at regional to national scales.","title":"Harmonic condition monitoring"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Detecting changes in surface conditions requires establishing reference or \"baseline\" conditions to be used for comparison.

This approach is particularly suited for monitoring using vegetation indices in regions/ecosystems with strong phenological signals. We use the following model form: where y is the predicted vegetation index (e.g. Tasseled Cap Greenness), x is the ordinal date of each observation; a 0 is the modeled intercept; b 0 is the modeled slope; N is a set of integers specifying the frequency, j , of the Fourier series harmonics (e.g. N = {1, 3}, corresponding to 12-month and 4-month harmonics); a j are the sine coefficients and b j are the cosine coefficients estimated at each frequency; T is the number of days in a year ( T = 365.25); and \u03b5 t is the residual error term for each observation. Condition Scores \u00b6 Condition scores are calculated as the difference between the observed and predicted reflectance values for a given acquisition date, and are normalized by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the baseline model used to generate the predicted value: Thus, scores represent the magnitude of change in reflectance relative to the uncertainty in baseline model fit. Ensemble Approach \u00b6 Previous implementations of this workflow have relied on a single baseline model for prediction and monitoring such that a single condition score is generated for each acquisition date. However, selection of a suitable baseline period may be challenging in frequently disturbed landscapes and noise in reflectance observations may impact the quality of models fit to different time periods. Therefore, the latest version of our workflow utilizes an ensemble approach that combines condition scores estimates from multiple baselines. Baseline models are fit using a moving window and the n models preceding the specified monitoring period are used to generate a set of condition score estimates for each acquired image during the specified monitoring period. These scores can then be averaged across all dates within the monitoring period to produce a more robust estimate of potential condition change. Our final assessment products combine results across Landsat Paths and include per-pixel mean and standard deviation of scores as well as number of observations used for monitoring.","title":"Harmonic modeling"},{"location":"harmonics/#condition-scores","text":"Condition scores are calculated as the difference between the observed and predicted reflectance values for a given acquisition date, and are normalized by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the baseline model used to generate the predicted value: Thus, scores represent the magnitude of change in reflectance relative to the uncertainty in baseline model fit.","title":"Condition Scores"},{"location":"harmonics/#ensemble-approach","text":"Previous implementations of this workflow have relied on a single baseline model for prediction and monitoring such that a single condition score is generated for each acquisition date.
